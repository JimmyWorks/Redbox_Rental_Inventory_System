# Redbox_Rental_Inventory_System
[ 4/11/2017] A Java program simulating a Redbox Rental Service utilizing custom binary search trees (BST) and customized nodes, recursion to traverse the BST, breadth-first traversal print, customized queue and queue node classes to utilize breadth-first traversal, exception-handling and error-logging, and more!

Contents:
    - src folder: contains all the Java code needed to run the program.  
    - transaction.log: needed to process transactions
    - inventory.dat: needed to loaded the Redbox machine (and the BST)
        Note: if transaction.log or inventory.dat is not included or local to src folder, the program will prompt you for the name or path to     
              the input files you want to use (or you can change them at the top of the program).  
    - redbox_kiosk.txt: sample final inventory report 
    - error.log: sample error log
    
    All sample files are the correct output files for the program using the sample input files.  Cheers!
